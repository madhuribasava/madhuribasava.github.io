                <h3>Project 3 - Diabetes Indicator</h3>
                <p>This Project is on the Diabetes Indicator. 
				I have taken 3 datasets from the Kaggle website
				and created 3 new files with only 5 records each. Combined them into one dataset and performed the diabetes analysis. This Project is done in the ‘R’ language. 
				The analysis gave us the idea of which factors are more likely to cause diabetes and share the results with everyone so that people will change their lifestyles accordingly to reduce diabetes problems in the future.</p>
                <p><strong>Technology:</strong> R Language</p>

                <h3>Project 5 - Books Project</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this project is to consolidate all the book’s data into records which I can store in the database to serve the customers effectively as all the data will be in one place. First, I took the books.csv file downloaded from the internet and applied transformations. I cleaned the data as necessary and saved it in a CSV file. Link to books.csv: https://www.kaggle.com/code/aiswaryarana/7k-books/input?select=books.csv Second, I scraped the website for book data and applied transformations to clean the data and format it as necessary. Link to website: https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/table-examples/catalog-of-books/ Third, I called APIs to get the book data based on the ISBN value, applied some transformations to it, and saved it to a CSV file. Link to the website to call the API: https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books Fourth, I read all the above three CSV files into individual data frames, connected them to the SQLite database, and saved them into three tables. Fifth, I combined the three tables into a single table based on the common ISBN, created a data frame from it, and applied visualizations.</p>

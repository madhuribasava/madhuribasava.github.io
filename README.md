## Developer Portfolio -  My Data Science Projects Showcase
Welcome to my developer portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of my projects, demonstrating my skills, 
creativity, and dedication to delivering high-quality software solutions.


## 1) Customer Experience	
Google Trends Project: Explains Customer Experience in various 	sectors (Finance, Health care, Shopping) with Google Trends 
in many aspects like Online shopping, Clothing trends, Video games, toys, cosmetics, and electronics.

## 2) Cash Register Python Project
This Project creates a cash register and requests to enter the price and quantity and the item gets added to the cart. 
 Finally, it displays all the items in the cart. This Project is done In Python language.

## 3) Diabetes Indicator Project in ‘R’ Language
This Project is on the Diabetes Indicator. I have taken 3 datasets from the Kaggle website. And create 3 new files
 with only 50 records each. Combined them into one dataset and performed the diabetes analysis. This Project is done in the ‘R’ 
 language. The analysis gave us the idea of which factors are more likely to cause diabetes and share the results with everyone
 so that people will change their lifestyles accordingly to reduce diabetes problems in the future.

## 4) Music and Mental Health Project
This Project aims to analyze the effects of Music on Mental health. Various features that affect mental health like
age, depression, insomnia, anxiety, and the number of hours of music listening are analyzed and found that music listening
can decrease mental health issues.

## 5) Books Project
The purpose of this project is to consolidate all the book’s data into records which I can store in the database to 
 serve the customers effectively as all the data will be in one place.
 First, I took the books.csv file downloaded from the internet and applied transformations. I cleaned the data as necessary 
 and saved it in a CSV file. Link to books.csv: https://www.kaggle.com/code/aiswaryarana/7k-books/input?select=books.csv
 Second, I scraped the website for book data and applied transformations to clean the data and format it as necessary.

 Third, I called APIs to get the book data based on the ISBN value, applied some transformations to it, and saved it to a CSV file.
 Link to the website to call the API: https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books
 Fourth, I read all the above three CSV files into individual data frames, connected them to the SQLite database, and saved them
 into three tables.
 Fifth, I combined the three tables into a single table based on the common ISBN, created a data frame from it, 
 and applied visualizations.

## 6) MentalHealthProject
This is the Predictive Analytics Project done in Python. This project aims to properly identify individuals in our 
 community who require mental health treatment, provide early intervention, and deliver personalized mental health support.
 This is an achievable reality through the implementation of machine learning in mental health assessment.

## 7) Autism Prediction Project
This project focuses on improving Autism Screening by creating models that can predict the likelihood of the individual
 suffering from autism based on the given features.

## 8) Big Data Project
This project’s objective is to find which city in the US has the most illnesses so we can build facilities and provide
 more services to improve people’s health. Big Data Components used for this project are HDFS, Spark, and Yarn. The big city 
 health dataset is uploaded into HDFS and seamlessly integrated into Spark. PySpark is used for data analysis and machine learning
 integration.

## 10) Airline Fatalities Project
This is the Analytics Project done in Python. This project aims to identify the future trends 
of airline accidents and demonstrates that flight travel is safe. It involves power point 
presentations for internal audience and Blog Post and Infographics for external audience.
